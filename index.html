    <h2><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Fenix" rel="stylesheet">My Name Is Andrew Lee</h2>
      <p>My first name is James but I go by Andrew because im the third.I'm a coder from the Kansas City Area. I've been coding for a little while now, but before that I attended Mcc-Blue River for two years. While I was there I played on the men's soccer team for both years. I went to Germany in the spring of 2017 to pursue a career in soccer, so I came just shy of my degree. While I was there I learned a lot about other cultures as well as myself. When I came back I realized that I needed to find something I liked enough to make a career out of. I spent a few months searching for what I liked, then a friend mentioned coding. I started to watch a few youtube videos on it and I havenâ€™t looked back since.</p>
    <h2><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Fenix" rel="stylesheet">I'm From</h2>
    <p>Kansas City, i've bounced around the metro area a few times but I've never strayed too far. I'm the youngest of four, I have to brothers and a sister who I often found myself looking up since theres an 8 year gap between my closest sibling and I. I graduated from Raytown High School. I went to school on and off from 2012 - present, but I never found anything interesting enough to pursue a degree in.</p>
